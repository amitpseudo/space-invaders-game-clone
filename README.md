# Space Invaders Game Clone

A Python-based clone of the classic arcade game **Space Invaders**. Built using the Pygame library, this project offers a fun and simple gaming experience, featuring player control of a spaceship, shooting bullets to destroy incoming enemies, and dynamic score tracking. The game also includes sound effects and background music for an enhanced gaming experience.

## Features

- **Player Spaceship Control**: Move the spaceship left and right and fire bullets at enemies.
- **Enemies**: Randomly generated waves of enemy spaceships that descend toward the player.
- **Collision Detection**: Destroy enemies by hitting them with bullets.
- **Score Tracking**: Keep track of your score as you shoot down enemies.
- **Game Over Condition**: The game ends when an enemy reaches the player, with a "Game Over" sound effect.
- **Audio**: Background music (`02. Select Your Ship.mp3`) and game-over sound (`gameover.wav`).
